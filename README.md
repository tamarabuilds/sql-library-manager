Unit 08 project for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. This project is a web app to list, add, update and delete books to manage a fictional library with a SQLite database.



## How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite, and the SQL ORM Sequelize

----I used npm to manage packages necessary for the project. This includes express and pug so you'll need to run 'npm install' in the project folder if you want to run the files locally.


## Optimizations

----I spent a lot of time working on managing errors. There's even a server test error page if you navigate to '/error'


## Lessons Learned

Picked up a bunch of skills including:
 * Setting up an express server
 * Adding true data persistence to projects.
 * How to implement, modify, interact, and maintain a local custom SQLite database.
 * 
 * Setting routes and middleware
 * Creating Pug templates 
 * Efficiently setting up gitpages for my projects
 * Importance of standardizing my READMEs


## Extra Features

* Search field added to work off the following fields: Title, Author, Genre, Year
* Pagination was added to the books listing page.
* Structure, style and CSS were updated:
  * Updated font to Lexend to improve readability. Learn more: https://www.lexend.com/
  * A custom logo favicon was added as a little star.
  * ---Background color for the sidebar was updated.
  * ---All image and button borders are rounded off.
